# Quora-similar-question-detection
Designed and implemented a machine learning-based system for detecting similar questions on Quora, aimed at enhancing user experience and content quality. 
Utilized natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess and vectorize textual data, enabling comparison of question similarities. 
Explored various ML algorithms, including but not limited to, cosine similarity, Word2Vec, and Siamese neural networks, to capture semantic similarities between questions.
